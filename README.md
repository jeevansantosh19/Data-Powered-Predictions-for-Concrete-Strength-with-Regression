# Data Powered Predictions for Concrete Strength with Regression

This project demonstrates the prediction of concrete strength using multiple regression models. It features a user-friendly interface for data input and presents results with model evaluation metrics.

## Features

- **Input Form**: Users can input values for various parameters like cement, slag, flyash, water, etc.
- **Prediction Results**: Concrete strength predictions using:
  - Linear Regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- **Model Metrics**: Detailed evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
